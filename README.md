# ðŸŽ“ Student Grade Classifier

A machine learning web application that predicts a student's final grade class (Aâ€“F) based on behavioral, demographic, and extracurricular activity data.

Built with:
- **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface
- **Scikit-learn** for training and deploying the classification model
- **Matplotlib** for real-time probability visualization

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts grade category (A, B, C, D, or F) from 13 student features
- Real-time probability confidence chart
- Personalized feedback based on prediction result
- Clean, responsive Streamlit web UI

## ðŸ“ˆ Data Inputs

The model uses the following 13 features:
- Age
- Gender
- Ethnicity
- Parental Education Level
- Weekly Study Time
- Number of Absences
- Tutoring (Yes/No)
- Parental Support Level
- Extracurricular Activities (Yes/No)
- Sports Participation (Yes/No)
- Music Participation (Yes/No)
- Volunteering (Yes/No)

## ðŸ”® How It Works

1. User inputs their personal and academic information through the Streamlit app.
2. The trained Random Forest model predicts the final grade class (Aâ€“F).
3. The app displays the prediction result along with a probability distribution chart.
4. Personalized motivational feedback is provided based on the predicted class.
